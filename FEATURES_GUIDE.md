  - Currency symbol ($, ₹, €, AED, etc.)
  - Currency position (before or after amount)
  - Default tax rate
  - Restaurant name

**Option B: Current Implementation:**
- The system has a `AppSettings` model with default values
- Currency defaults to "$" but can be changed globally
- All prices throughout the app will automatically use this currency

**To modify now:**
- Open `database.service.ts`
- The `getSettings()` method returns default currency as "$"
- You can change this to your currency (e.g., "AED", "₹", "PKR")
